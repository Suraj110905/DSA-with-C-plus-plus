//Bitwise operator(bit level operations)

//are works on bit-level. So, compiler first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands.

/*
Name	         Symbol         	Description
Binary           AND	&	       Copies a bit to the evaluated result if it exists in both operands
Binary           OR	    |	       Copies a bit to the evaluated result if it exists in any of the operand
Binary           XOR	^	       Copies the bit to the evaluated result if it is present in either of the operands but not both
Left Shift	     <<	               Shifts the value to left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
Right Shift	     >>	               Shifts the value to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
One's Complement	    ~	       Changes binary digits 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
